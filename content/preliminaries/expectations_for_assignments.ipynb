    "# Expectations for Submitted Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this short notebook, we'll discuss expectations for submitted  assignments, including homework and in-class assignments. The same expectations will apply to the midterm and final exam. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Format\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that you complete most of your homework assignments in Jupyter Notebooks. Most of you will find this to be both easier and more fun. It's also easy for us to grade. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a backup, you may instead choose to do your homework in `.py` files (i.e. Python script files). This is discouraged unless (a) you are having issues running Jupyter or (b) the Jupyter interface is not accessible to you. **You must notify me in advance** if you intend to submit `.py` files for your homework assignments or exams. You do not need to state your reason for doing so, but you do need to tell me ahead of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the expectations described below will apply equally to both notebook-based assignments and `.py`-based assignments. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Do Not Submit `.ipynb` Files\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is natively a file of format `.ipynb`. **Do not submit `.ipynb` files. We will not grade `.ipynb` files.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, submit `.html` files. To do so, with your notebook open, navigate to `File > Download As > HTML (.html)`. Submit the resulting `.html` file on Canvas. "

    "\n",
    "The top of your assignment should include the homework assignment number (e.g. \"HW4\"), your name, and the date. It should also include the honor statement shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Expository Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook should include expository text that (a) states the problem you are solving and (b) describes the operation of each code chunk. We will provide you with an outline of each homework assignment that includes the problem statements, so if you use the outline then that will satisfy (a). An example of (b) is shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments and Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should include comments and docstrings. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Comments** (marked in Python with a `#`) explain the intention and operation of small lines or blocks of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Docstrings** give a detailed explanation of the inputs and outputs of a function. Docstrings are typically placed directly below the first line of a function definition. They are placed between three pairs of quotation marks `\"\"\"like this\"\"\"`. You won't need to worry about docstrings until we discuss defining functions. "
