    "In many cases, it's desirable to implement **memory** in some form. For example, we might want a function that keeps track of how many time it's been called, or a simulation that keeps track of its current state. As we discussed a few lectures ago, global variables provide a highly unsafe solution to this problem. Instead, take an object-oriented approach! Here's a very simple object that keeps track of the number of times its `increment` method has been called. "
