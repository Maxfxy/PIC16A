## Cheatsheets


- [Numpy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Numpy_Python_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)* : numerical arrays. 
- [Matplotlib](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Python_Matplotlib_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)* : 2d data visualization.
- [Pandas](https://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/dbed353d-2757-4617-8206-8767ab379ab3)* : tabular data.  
- [Scikit-Learn](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Scikit_Learn_Cheat_Sheet_Python.pdf)* : machine learning. 


\*These worksheets are assembled by DataCamp, a company that produces online tutorials in topics related to data science. DataCamp has institutionally defended their CEO against [credible accusations](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/daveyalba/datacamp-sexual-harassment-metoo-tech-startup) of sexual harassment and assault toward an employee. That said, I do believe that the free cheat sheets they produce are the best available on several topics. I do not otherwise support DataCamp and do not suggest that you use any of their paid resources. 

## Helpful Readings

- [Python Cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/). Not so much a "cheatsheet" as a very rapid review of many fundamental concepts, including a convenient table of contents. 
- [*A Whirlwind Tour of Python*](https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf) by Jake VanderPlas. A sequence of online notebooks covering Python basics, with an eye towards data science. Inspiration for several lectures in the first part of the course.
