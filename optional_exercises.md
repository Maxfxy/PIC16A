### L1: Basics

***Note***: *in some of these exercises, the solutions are shown as functions. If you see the `def` keyword in the solution, that's what's going on. We haven't learned functions yet, although you might be able to recognize some of the main ideas from C++. In any case, you can usually understand the solution just by focusing on what comes after the line involving `def`.*

### L10: Numpy II

***Note***: *You can learn something useful from most of the exercises on the linked page. However, if you're not sure how to do something, it's worth trying to Google around for an appropriate `numpy` function rather than trying to build your approach "from scratch."*

- [Mean across axes](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/numpy/python-numpy-math.php): Exercise 19
- [More axis tricks](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/numpy/python-numpy-math.php): Exercise 27

### Pandas I (Manipulating Data Frames)

- [Filtering practice](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/pandas/filter/index.php). All the exercises on this page are quite useful, actually. A few you could try first are Exercises 1, 2, 4, and 12. The best way to start these exercises is by downloading the supplied data and reading it with `pd.read_csv()`. 
- [Detecting NaN values](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/pandas/missing-values/index.php): Exercise 2. 
- [Counting NaN values](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/pandas/missing-values/index.php): Exercise 3. 
- [Dropping rows](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/pandas/missing-values/index.php): Exercise 5.
- [Dropping rows again](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/pandas/missing-values/index.php): Exercise 7. 

### Pandas II (Summarizing Data Frames)

- [Split-apply-combine practice](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/pandas/groupby/index.php): Exercise 2. *The easiest way to get the data for this example is to copy and paste the text into a CSV file and read it in via `pd.read_csv()`*
- [Counting unique values](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/pandas/groupby/index.php): Exercise 15. *You might want to Google around for a relevant function here.*
