**Welcome to PIC16A!** I'm Phil Chodrow, your instructor, and I'm grateful that you're here. Before we dive into the details, I want to lay out some guiding principles for this course: 

1. **I want you to succeed.** The purpose of this course is for you to build a set of skills that can support you in your studies, hobbies, and careers. You (yes, **you**) are able to learn some cool stuff and get a good grade in this course. 
2. **None of us signed up for this.** We are all doing the best we can during a time of catastrophe and intense uncertainty. My main aims in designing this course are to (a) offer you flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and (b) encourage you to support and be supported by your classmates. Python programming is fun, and I hope that this course can be a positive part of your experience during these difficult times. 
3. **Your wellbeing comes first.** If at any time during this course, you require accommodations in order to ensure your own wellbeing or that of a loved one, please reach out to me. We will make it happen. 
4. **We've got your back.** I'll be available to you through multiple channels. Additionally, you have an amazing support team -- your TAs, LAs, and peers will all be helping you in your learning journey.  

Ok, now on to the usual syllabus stuff. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Course Overview </div>

This course covers the fundamental constructs of the Python programming language, and then surveys some tools often used in computational and data science. Together, we will:  

1. Construct Python programs using functions, loops, classes, and other tools. 
2. Make design decisions about the programming constructs best suited to a given problem. 
3. Write *reusable* code, by encapsulating core operations inside functions and documenting these functions carefully. 
4. Use our skills to study data sets from science, economics, politics, and literature. 

You can also consult the provisional [course schedule](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A/schedule/).

### Homework

There will be approximately 7 homework assignments throughout the quarter. You should consult the [expectations for submitted assignments](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PhilChodrow/PIC16A/blob/master/content/w1/expectations_for_assignments.ipynb) for guidance on how to document and submit your work. The lowest two homework scores will be dropped. 

### Participation

Your participation score does **not** include lecture attendance. Attendance at scheduled lecture sessions is **encouraged but optional**. You can, in principle, achieve a 100% in this course without ever attending a scheduled lecture section. Of course, attendance at lecture will help you learn the material more rapidly and thoroughly. Scheduled lecture sessions will include Q&A, discussion, and both individual and group activities.

**Attendance at discussion sessions is required**, except in circumstances that make this extremely difficult (such as lack of internet access or time zone issues). In this case, the preferred solution is for a group of students in similar circumstances to arrange an alternate meeting time. 

Discussion sections will include **graded** group work, including exercises and creative problem-solving. This graded work is the basis of your participation score. I will send a questionnaire during Week 0 in which you can state inability to attend discussion sections. In this case, I will contact you and we will find alternative arrangements. The lowest five grades from discussion assignments will be dropped. 

### Quizzes

All traditional lectures will be pre-recorded and available online. Each week on Wednesdays, there will be a quiz consisting primarily of comprehension questions related to the lecture videos. Quizzes will be **timed**. The lowest two quiz grades will be dropped. 

### Midterm Exam

The midterm exam will take place on _____. You will have one hour to complete the final exam, and can take the exam at any time between 12:00am and 11:59pm on _____. This exam is open-book and open-notes.  

### Final Exam

The final exam for this course is scheduled for December 17th, 2020. You will have 3 hours to complete the final exam, and can take the exam at any time between 12:00am and 11:59pm on December 17th. This exam is open-book and open-notes.  

### Extra Credit

There are two ways to earn extra credit in PIC16A. 

#### Essay

At any time prior to the end of instruction (Friday, December 11, 2020), you may submit an essay of approximately 600 words (two double-spaced pages) on a topic broadly related to the themes of algorithms, equity, and justice. This essay will be graded out of 3 points, and the result will be added as a percentage to your final average in the course. For instance, if your essay earns 2 points, 2% will be added to your final average. 

Your essay should satisfy the following criteria, **each of which is worth one point.**  

- **Sources**: The essay should cite and elaborate on at least three news articles, blog posts, or other sources. Opinion articles do not count. You should use a consistent citation convention. If you're not sure which one to use, [APA](https://www.library.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/apa_2010.pdf) and [MLA](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html) are both good choices. 
- **Argument**: The essay should have a *thesis statement*, which is supported by the discussion of the sources. Several examples of successful thesis statements: 
    - *Taken together, these articles suggest that algorithmic surveillance of marginalized groups is only increasing with time.*
    - *Although studies have revealed significant biases in Google Search, more recent work suggests that these biases may be less important in practice than once believed.*
    - *While many proposals exist for how algorithms and computation can be used to combat climate change, these proposals often overlook the role of human interpretation in implementing computer-generating guidance.*
- **Grammar and Writing**: Your essay should be written in grammatical English, with complete sentences and careful punctuation. 

The [Undergraduate Writing Center](https://wp.ucla.edu/wc/) is an excellent resource for helping you craft high-quality essays. 

**Suggestions for Sources**

You are free to use any sources to which you have access. If you are having trouble getting started, the following may be useful starting places. 

- The [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/about) maintains a [library](https://www.ajl.org/library/home) of articles and announcements that may help you find suitable material. Especially relevant for topics at the intersection of algorithms and racial justice. 
- A [list of articles](https://blog.getpocket.com/2020/06/the-bias-embedded-in-algorithms/) on bias in algorithms. This list is curated by Safiya Umoja Noble, author of [Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism](https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/) and faculty here at UCLA. 
- Cathy O'Neil, author of the excellent book *Weapons of Math Destruction*, has a [blog](https://mathbabe.org/page/2/). Many of her posts are opinion pieces (and therefore unsuitable for citation), but she always provides links to primary material, which you can use. 

#### Discussion Forum

There is a discussion forum associated with this course, where you can post both questions and answers about the course content. If you post a particularly insightful question or answer, I will (at my discretion) award you 0.5% of extra credit toward your final grade. You can earn extra credit this way up to four times, for a total of 2% extra credit.

<div class="fancy-h1">Course Environment </div>

<div class="blocks">
    <div class="pink-bg">

        You deserve to be welcomed and celebrated by our community. We embrace diversity of age, background, beliefs, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, gender expression, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, and other visible and non-visible categories. <b>Discrimination is not tolerated in my classroom.</b>
    </div>
    <div class="lightblue-bg">
        <h3>Title IX</h3>
        You deserve a learning environment free from discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. If you experience these behaviors or otherwise know of a Title IX violation, you have many options for support and/or reporting. The UCLA <a href="https://www.sexualharassment.ucla.edu/">Title IX Office</a> can help you navigate your options.  
    </div>
    <div class="yellow-bg">
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        You deserve to fully and equitably participate in our learning environment.

<br>

<div class="fancy-h1"> Collaboration and Academic Honesty</div>

I heartily encourage you to collaborate with your peers on homework and many in-class activities. You should ask questions, brainstorm ideas, and offer suggestions *at a conceptual level.* In general, **you should not share code with your peers** in any circumstances, as this deprives them of the opportunity to learn how to operationalize their ideas. 

The quizzes, midterm, and finals are open-book and open-notes. You should not discuss any aspect of these evaluations with your peers, and doing so will constitute a violation of UCLA's [student code of conduct](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Individual-Student-Code). 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Getting Help </div>

## Coding Problems

If you are struggling with a problem on a homework assignment, or wondering about an in-class activity, you have several ways to get help. In approximate order, you should try: 

1. Posting your question on the class discussion forum. 
2. Attending the next MWF lecture period, which I will often use for Q&A. 
3. Attending the office hours of either myself or the TA. 

## General Academic Concerns

If you have concerns about your grades, general understanding, or ability to keep up in the course, you should initiate a conversation with me. We will set up a separate meeting to make sure you have the resources you need to succeed in PIC16A. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Listening </div>
