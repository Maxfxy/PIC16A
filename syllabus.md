**Welcome to PIC16A!** I'm Phil Chodrow, Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics, and I'm grateful that you're here. Before we dive into the details, I want to lay out some guiding principles for this course: 

1. **I want you to succeed.** The purpose of this course is for you to build a set of skills that can support you in your studies, hobbies, and careers. You (yes, **you**) are able to learn some cool stuff and get a good grade in this course. 
2. **None of us signed up for this.** We are all doing the best we can during a time of catastrophe and intense uncertainty. My main aims in designing this course are to (a) offer you flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and (b) encourage you to support and be supported by your classmates. Python programming is fun, and I hope that this course can be a positive part of your experience during these difficult times. 
3. **Your wellbeing comes first.** If at any time during this course, you require accommodations in order to ensure your own wellbeing or that of a loved one, please reach out to me. We will make it happen. 
4. **We've got your back.** I'll be available to you through multiple channels. Additionally, you have an amazing support team -- your TAs, LAs, and peers will all be helping you in your learning journey.  

Ok, now on to the usual syllabus stuff. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Course Overview </div>

This course covers the fundamental constructs of the Python programming language, and then surveys some computational tools often used in computational and data science. Together, we will:  

1. Construct Python programs using functions, loops, classes, and other tools. 
2. Make design decisions about the programming constructs best suited to a given problem. 
3. Write *reusable* code, by encapsulating core operations inside functions and documenting these functions carefully. 
4. Use our skills to study data sets from science, economics, politics, and literature. 

**Official course description:**

*Lecture, three hours; discussion, two hours. Enforced requisite: course 10A, Computer Science 31, or equivalent, with grades of C- or better. Python programming and programming with Python packages. General Python programming constructs; standard data structures, flow control, exception handling, and input and output. Object oriented programming with Python. Application programming with commonly used Python modules such as PyQt or tkinter, NumPy, SciPy, and NLTK. P/NP or letter grading.*

## Discussion: 


## Extra Credit

There are two ways to earn extra credit in PIC16A. 

### Essay 

At any time prior to the end of instruction (Friday, December 11, 2020), you may submit an essay of approximately 600 words (two double-spaced pages) on a topic broadly related to the themes of algorithms, equity, and justice. This essay will be graded out of 3 points, and the result will be added as a percentage to your final average in the course. For instance, if your essay earns 2 points, 2% will be added to your final average. 

Your essay should satisfy the following criteria, **each of which is worth one point.**  

- **Sources**: The essay should cite and elaborate on at least three news articles, blog posts, or other sources. Opinion articles do not count. You should use a consistent citation convention. If you're not sure which one to use, [APA](https://www.library.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/apa_2010.pdf) and [MLA](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html) are both good choices. 
- **Argument**: The essay should have a *thesis statement*, which is supported by the discussion of the sources. Several examples of successful thesis statements: 
    - *Taken together, these articles suggest that algorithmic surveillance of marginalized groups is only increasing with time.*
    - *Although studies have revealed significant biases in Google Search, more recent work suggests that these biases may be less important in practice than once believed.*
    - *While many proposals exist for how algorithms and computation can be used to combat climate change, these proposals often overlook the role of human interpretation in implementing computer-generating guidance.*
- **Grammar and Writing**: Your essay should be written in grammatical English, with complete sentences and careful punctuation. 

The [Undergraduate Writing Center](https://wp.ucla.edu/wc/) is an excellent resource for helping you craft high-quality essays. 

**Suggestsions for Sources**

You are free to use any sources to which you have access. If you are having trouble getting started, the following may be useful starting places. 

- The [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/about) maintains a [library](https://www.ajl.org/library/home) of articles and announcements that may help you find suitable material. Especially relevant for topics at the intersection of algorithms and racial justice. 
- A [list of articles](https://blog.getpocket.com/2020/06/the-bias-embedded-in-algorithms/) on bias in algorithms. This list is curated by Safiya Umoja Noble, author of [Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism](https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/) and faculty here at UCLA. 
- Cathy O'Neil, author of the excellent book *Weapons of Math Destruction*, has a [blog](https://mathbabe.org/page/2/). Many of her posts are opinion pieces (and therefore unsuitable for citation), but she always provides links to primary material, which you can use.
