1. **I want you to succeed.** The purpose of this course is for you to build a set of skills that can support you in your studies, hobbies, and careers. You (yes, **you**) are able to learn some cool stuff and get a good grade in this course. 
2. **None of us signed up for this.** We are all doing the best we can during a time of catastrophe and intense uncertainty. My main aims in designing this course are to (a) offer you flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and (b) encourage you to support and be supported by your classmates. Python programming is fun, and I hope that this course can be a positive part of your experience during these difficult times. 
3. **Your wellbeing comes first.** If at any time during this course, you require accommodations in order to ensure your own wellbeing or that of a loved one, please reach out to me. We will make it happen. 
4. **We've got your back.** I'll be available to you through multiple channels. Additionally, you have an amazing support team -- your TAs, LAs, and peers will all be helping you in your learning journey.  

Ok, now on to the usual syllabus stuff. 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Course Overview </div>

This course covers the fundamental constructs of the Python programming language, and then surveys some tools often used in computational and data science. Together, we will:  

1. Construct Python programs using functions, loops, classes, and other tools. 
2. Use existing modules and self-written code to solve complex problems. 
3. Make design decisions about the programming constructs best suited to a given problem. 
4. Write *reusable* code, by encapsulating core operations in functions and classes, and documenting these constructs carefully. 
5. Study problems and data sets from science, economics, politics, and literature. 

You can also consult the provisional [course schedule](https://philchodrow.github.io/PIC16A/schedule/).

### Homework

There will be approximately 8 homework assignments throughout the quarter. You should consult the [expectations for submitted assignments](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PhilChodrow/PIC16A/blob/master/content/w1/expectations_for_assignments.ipynb) for guidance on how to document and submit your work. The lowest two homework scores will be dropped. 

### Participation

Your participation score does **not** include lecture attendance. Attendance at scheduled lecture sessions is **encouraged but optional**. You can, in principle, achieve a 100% in this course without ever attending a scheduled lecture section. Of course, attendance at lecture will help you learn the material more rapidly and thoroughly. Scheduled lecture sessions will include Q&A, discussion, and both individual and group activities.

**Attendance at discussion sessions is required**, except in circumstances that make this extremely difficult (such as lack of internet access or time zone issues). In this case, the preferred solution is for a group of students in similar circumstances to arrange an alternate meeting time. 

Discussion sections will include **graded** group work, including exercises and creative problem-solving. This graded work is the basis of your participation score. I will send a questionnaire during Week 0 in which you can state inability to attend discussion sections. In this case, I will contact you and we will find alternative arrangements. The lowest five grades from discussion assignments will be dropped. 

### Quizzes

All traditional lectures will be pre-recorded and available online. Each lecture day, there will be a quiz consisting of questions related to that day's lecture videos and required readings. The primary purpose of the quizzes is to encourage you to study the required lecture content in time to apply your knowledge in the group Discussion sections. 

Quizzes are timed, and typically allow approximately 5 minutes per question. Quizzes are due at 11:59pm on the day of lecture. For example, a typical quiz on a Wednesday might consist of 3 questions, and can be taken in any contiguous 15-minute period that ends before 11:59pm that Wednesday. 

The lowest 7 quiz grades will be dropped. Lectures, lecture notes, and required readings will always be posted at least 48 hours before the quiz is due. 

### Mini-Project

There will be a short group mini-project due at the end of the course. Working with your group, you will produce a small data science project in which you will read, explore, train machine learning models, and communicate your findings using a real data set. Several Discussion sections in the second half of the course will be devoted to helping you get started on the stages of this mini-project. The project will be designed to require approximately 3-5 hours of group coding sessions outside of class times. It will be possible to start on the project by the end of Week 7, and you will have all the tools you need to finish the project by the end of Week 9. 

### Midterm Exam

The midterm exam will take place on Friday, October 30th. It will be released at 8am on the 10/30, and you will have 24 hours to complete it. The exam is intended to require approximately one hour of effort. This exam is open-book and open-notes.  

### Final Exam

The final exam for this course is scheduled for December 17th, 2020. The exame will be released at 8am on 12/17, and you will have 24 hours to complete it. The exam is intended to require approximately three hours of effort. This exam is open-book and open-notes.  

### Extra Credit

There are two ways to earn extra credit in PIC16A. 

#### Essay

At any time prior to the end of instruction (Friday, December 11, 2020), you may submit an essay of between 500 and 800 words (approximately two double-spaced pages) on a topic broadly related to the themes of algorithms, equity, and justice. Your essay should address a concrete problem; assess the current state of affairs; and suggest one or more paths forward. Examples of suitable topics related to algorithms and justice include but are no means limited to bias in facial recognition; the impact of automation on social services for the poor; and the role of technology in combatting climate change. You are welcome to argue any angle on your topic, provided that you can offer sound sources and argumentation. For example, you may argue that bias in facial recognition is a major problem in need of solution, or you may argue that no substantial problem exists. You are welcome to ask me about your sources and proposed argument before you begin writing.   

This essay will be graded out of 3 points, and the result will be added as a percentage to your final average in the course. For instance, if your essay earns 2 points, 2% will be added to your final average. 

Your essay should satisfy the following criteria, **each of which is worth one point.**  

- **Sources**: The essay should cite and elaborate on at least three news articles, blog posts, or other sources. Opinion articles do not count. You should use a consistent citation convention. If you're not sure which one to use, [APA](https://www.library.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/apa_2010.pdf) and [MLA](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html) are both good choices. Up to one source may be a documentary film, while at least two must be written. 
- **Argument**: The essay should have a *thesis statement*, which is supported by the discussion of the sources. Several examples of successful thesis statements: 
    - *Taken together, these articles suggest that algorithmic surveillance of marginalized groups is only increasing with time.*
    - *Although studies have revealed significant biases in Google Search, more recent work suggests that these biases may be less important in practice than once believed.*
    - *While many proposals exist for how algorithms and computation can be used to combat climate change, these proposals often overlook the role of human interpretation in implementing computer-generating guidance.*
- **Grammar and Writing**: Your essay should be written in grammatical English, with complete sentences and careful punctuation. 

The [Undergraduate Writing Center](https://wp.ucla.edu/wc/) is an excellent resource for helping you craft high-quality essays. 

**Suggestions for Sources**

You are free to use any sources to which you have access. If you are having trouble getting started, the following may be useful starting places. 

- The [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/about) maintains a [library](https://www.ajl.org/library/home) of articles and announcements that may help you find suitable material. Especially relevant for topics at the intersection of algorithms and racial justice. 
- A [list of articles](https://blog.getpocket.com/2020/06/the-bias-embedded-in-algorithms/) on bias in algorithms. This list is curated by Safiya Umoja Noble, author of [Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism](https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/) and faculty here at UCLA. 
- Cathy O'Neil, author of the excellent book *Weapons of Math Destruction*, has a [blog](https://mathbabe.org/page/2/). Many of her posts are opinion pieces (and therefore unsuitable for citation), but she always provides links to primary material, which you can use. 

#### Discussion Forum

There is a discussion forum associated with this course, where you can post both questions and answers about the course content. If you post a particularly insightful question or answer, I will (at my discretion) award you 0.5% of extra credit toward your final grade. You can earn extra credit this way up to four times, for a total of 2% extra credit.

<div class="fancy-h1">Learning on Zoom</div>

## Cameras

  We're all humans. Many of us are feeling isolated or lonely in the time of COVID. As your instructor, it brightens my day to see your faces. So, when attending lecture, **please consider turning your camera on**, if your situation admits. There is no judgement and no penalty for attending lecture in bed, in you pajamas, wrapped in a blanket, etc. Conversely, there is no penalty for leaving your camera off, and I will not inquire. 

  When working in groups in your discussion section, it is especially important to engage with your group members as peers, mentors, and individuals. You are **strongly encouraged** to turn your cameras on when working with your teams. LAs rotating through the groups may ask you why your camera is off. 

## Microphones

  In large meetings, it's good etiquette to mute your microphone when you are not actively talking. Feel free to unmute yourself when you have a question for me or for the TA. When working in small groups, leave your microphone on unless there's a lot of ambient noise. 

<div class="fancy-h1">Course Environment </div>

    </div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="fancy-h1"> Collaboration and Academic Honesty</div>

I heartily encourage you to collaborate with your peers on homework and many in-class activities. You should ask questions, brainstorm ideas, and offer suggestions *at a conceptual level.* In general, **you should not share code with your peers** in any circumstances, as this deprives them of the opportunity to learn how to operationalize their ideas. 

The quizzes, midterm, and finals are open-book and open-notes. You should not discuss any aspect of these evaluations with your peers, and doing so will constitute a violation of UCLA's [student code of conduct](https://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Individual-Student-Code). 

<div class="fancy-h1"> Getting Help </div>

## Extensions Policy

These are challenging times. From disease to internet access to political unrest, there are many reasons why you might struggle to complete your work on time. In awareness of this situation, PIC16A includes an large number of drops for homework, participation assignments, and quizzes -- around two weeks worth of drops in each category.  Additionally, there are several opportunities to earn a substantial amount of extra credit. 

Research indicates that students of varying cultural backgrounds may feel more or less comfortable asking for extensions on assignments. Because of this, **I will generally not grant extensions** on assignments. If you are not able to complete an assignment on time, you will need to use one of your drops. If you foresee that you will be unable to complete multiple weeks worth of assignments, then please contact me and we will find a solution.   

## Coding Problems

If you are struggling with a problem on a homework assignment, or wondering about an in-class activity, you have several ways to get help. In approximate order, you should try: 

1. Posting your question on the class discussion forum AND/OR asking your Discussion group members.  
2. Attending the next MWF lecture period, which will often be used for relevant examples or Q&A. 
3. Attending the office hours of either Kirill or myself. 

## General Academic Concerns

If you have concerns about your grades, general understanding, or ability to keep up in the course, you should initiate a conversation with me. We will set up a separate meeting to make sure you have the resources you need to succeed in PIC16A. 

## Screen Reader Accessibility

It is my sincere goal to ensure that this course is accessible to users of screen readers. It has come to my attention that, the posted lecture notes, it may at times be difficult for screen reader users to distinguish between code input and code output. I have done the following: 

1. Code blocks are preceded by an indicator of the form `In [2]`, standing for "Input Number 2."  
2. When a code block returns a value, the output is preceded by an indicator of the form `Out[2]`, standing for "Output Number 2."
3. When a code block does not return a value, such as when a `print` statement is used, the output is not preceded by an output indicator. Instead, I have added a comment `# ---` between the input code and the printed output. 

Thus, input and output blocks are separated by either an `Out[2]` indicator or a comment `# ---`. 

If you have additional suggestions for how the course can be better made accessible to users of screen readers or other assistive technologies, I will receive them gratefully.
